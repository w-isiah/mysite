# Assuming you are using a simple MySQL schema for the user table:
# CREATE TABLE users (
#     id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
#     username VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
#     password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
# );
# This file is not strictly necessary, as user data is handled in `auth.py`.

# Optionally, you can define a User model here, but for simplicity,
# database operations are being done directly in the routes.
